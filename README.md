## Hello, Coursera friend!

Here are my attempts to complete this assignment. I did not enjoy munging together the date and time values for plot2, this caused me some intial problems. Hopefully everything is correct - thanks a lot for taking the time to review.

I didn't include the data file (txt file) in the repo because it's ludicrously big - 120mb. In the header comments of each script are instructions on how you can get this data if you wanted to (but you already know how to do that!).

**Best of luck with the course!**
